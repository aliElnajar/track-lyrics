### what i've used in the project
1. ive used react-router to navigate between home page and single track lyrics page
2. MUI in desiging the project's ui and got advantage of the breakpoints to make it responsive
3. public api (musixmatch) and there was a CORS problem solved by cors-anywhere it helps to access the data for the browser 
4. used custom react hook to fetch data to follow the (dry principle)
